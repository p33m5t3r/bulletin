below is an rss entry from the lesswrong frontpage feed. you should read the article, and use the 'process_article' tool. you are welcome to think in your reply before using the tool, but the output of the tool call is the only thing which will be looked at by the caller. The summary will be displayed on a news aggregator, and should be extremely brief. Your job is to use the tool to determine whether the post is related to ai (and hence worth including) and, if so, to write said brief summary. ONLY include posts that are *focused* on AI in one way or another. be casual and concise. shorter summaries are better. think "new yorker article teaser". pithy.
